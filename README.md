## Overview
- This project involves the exploratory data analysis and data visualization of the Emergency - 911 calls data from Montgomery County in Pennsylvania made throughout the time of the year and also for which common reasons/incidents 911 calls are usually made during which part of the year.

- In this projest we were able to practice many different visualization techniques while exploring the dataset. We used pandas to create dataframes and analyze through our data, extracting, reorganizing and graphing important data categories that we want to visualize. For the dataset, we found the EMS-related calls represented the most 911 calls, followed by traffic and then fire.

- This project is developed on a Jupyter notebook using `Python` with Data Analysis libraries: `NumPy` and `Pandas` along with Data Visualization libraries: `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
